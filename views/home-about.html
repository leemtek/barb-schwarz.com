                                    Barb Schwarz has Educated Realtors®, Home Stagers, and the Public on Home Staging since the early 70’s. Barb is
                                    the Creator, Inventor and True Visionary who came up with the Staging Concept. She has built the Staging Industry
                                    from day one before any others had thought of it. There was no Staging concept in the Real Estate Industry at all
                                    until she came up with the Home Staging Concept. Barb Invented the Home Staging Concept and industry when she entered
                                    the world of Real Estate as an Agent in Bellevue, WA in the early 70’s. She quickly saw and realized the need sellers
                                    have of preparing their homes for sale. Her background in the theater in musicals and off Broadway plays gave her the
                                    idea of setting the scene and setting the Stage® in houses for buyers to see properties in the best way. This is how
                                    she came up with her concepts and called it Home Staging. Barb has frequently said that her invention of Home Staging
                                    was a gift from God.  Her focus, ideas, vision, and creativity in this area became her mission and to this very day her
                                    passion grows more every-day. Her mission is to help create a better world through better home environments through the
                                    magic of Home Staging.

                                    Barb Schwarz is the Founder of Stagedhomes.com. When Barb opened up the site Stagedhomes.com there was no educational site in the world
                                    exclusively for Home Staging. Therefore, StagedHomes.com was the very first Staging Educational website in the world and is the
                                    Internationally recognized world-wide today as the leader in the Home Staging Industry.  Barb knew when she built Stagedhomes.com that
                                    the public needed to be educated on what Home Staging is, she knew that Home Stagers needed to be trained, certified, designated, and
                                    accredited, Barb knew then that the public would want a directory to find the right Stager or Agent for them, she knew that people would
                                    want to find Staged Homes to buy, and that in addition to training Home Stagers and RE Agents they would need materials to use on a
                                    regular basis with their clients and she knew that a Home Staging Association would be crucial to set more standards to continue to raise
                                    the bar on the Home Staging industry she created. So Barb built Stagedhomes.com one page at a time and began with the 6 main sections that
                                    stand today to inform the world on the following:

                                    Garden is like Life.  I see it all of the time and we are each an important part of the Garden
                                    of Life. As a child I had a garden and loved every minute in it. My Grandparents, especially
                                    my Grandmother, taught me ideas I use to this very day in my Garden now. I hope you will enjoy
